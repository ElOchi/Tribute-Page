It denied the reality, and power, and authenticity of the world, saying, ‘This cannot exist; it cannot exist.’ “March 20, 1974: It seized me entirely, lifting me from the limitations of the space-time matrix; it mastered me as, at the same time, I knew that the world around me was cardboard, a fake. Through its power of perception I saw what really existed, and through its power of no-thought decision, I acted to free myself. It took on in battle, as a champion of all human spirits in thrall, every evil, every Iron Imprisoning thing.” These visions influence his writing for the rest of his career. He focuses on selfexamination and keeps an 8,000 page journal of his thoughts, known as his “Exegesis.”
